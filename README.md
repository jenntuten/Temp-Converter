# Temp-Converter
This temperature converter is based on a Codecademy project. I added some tweaks to it to ensure that the converter does not return any non-existent temperatures. As a note, 0 Kelvin is "absolute zero", and temperature is not measured below that point. This equates to about -459.67 Fahrenheit and -273.15 Celsius. For example, if you enter -500 degrees and click on "Fahrenheit" to convert, the user will receive a message stating that this is not an accurate temperature.\
